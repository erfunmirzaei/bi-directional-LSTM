# Overview

In this project, we implemented a Neural Network based on bi-directional LSTM for the sentence-level relation classification. Today there are many ways to solve these problems. However, in the project, we used an RNN-based model because it is capable of learning long-distance relation patterns, making it suitable for real-world applications where complicated expressions are often involved. SemEval-2010 Task 8 was used as a dataset for this purpose. The data set includes training and test data. The training dataset consists of 8,000 examples, and the testing set consists of 2,717 examples from the nine relations and the additional Other relation.
